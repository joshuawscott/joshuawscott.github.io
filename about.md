I'm Joshua Scott, I'm a programmer and database enthusiast. Ruby on Rails,
JavaScript, Redis, PostgreSQL are my day job, and I play with Elixir, Clojure,
Erlang, C, Graph Databases, Key/Value stores, Unity, hardware prototyping, and 
anything else that captures my fancy.

I work at [Simpli.fi](http://www.simpli.fi), but my opinions are my own. We're
almost always looking for people who love to learn and are serious about 
programming and scaling.
